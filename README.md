### Stopwords
```Python
words = [token.text for token in words if not token.is_stop]
```

Stopwords are common words that are often removed in natural language processing (NLP) tasks because they carry less meaningful information compared to other words in a text. Examples of stopwords include "the," "is," "in," "and," etc. By removing these words, the focus is on the more significant words that contribute to the meaning and context of the text, potentially improving the performance of NLP models.



### Lemmatization
```Python
words = [token.lemma_ for token in nlp(words)]
```
Lemmatization is more efficient than stemming because it reduces words to their base or dictionary form while considering context and morphological structure, leading to more accurate and meaningful results. Unlike stemming, which often produces non-existent words by crudely chopping off endings, lemmatization ensures that the root forms are valid and contextually appropriate. This context-awareness preserves the original meaning of words and enhances the performance of NLP applications, making lemmatization a superior choice for tasks like text analysis, information retrieval, and natural language understanding.

For example, the word "better" is correctly lemmatized to "good," whereas stemming might incorrectly reduce it to "bett," which is not a valid word.

### Words Correction
```Python
user_input = [spell.correction(word) for word in user_input]
```
You have a sentence with a typo, and you want to correct it using a SpellChecker. The program you're using doesn't automatically understand or correct typos, so you incorporate a SpellChecker to handle this task.

Input Sentence with Typo:

Example: "I have a pedn."

The program processes text but doesnâ€™t recognize that "pedn" is a typo.


The SpellChecker scans the sentence for words that are not in its dictionary of correct words.
In this case, it identifies "pedn" as a typo.
Suggest Corrections:
The SpellChecker provides suggestions for the incorrect word based on its algorithms, which often consider common misspellings, phonetic similarity, and context.
The program replaces "pedn" with the suggested correction "pen".

The final output after correction is: "I have a pen."
